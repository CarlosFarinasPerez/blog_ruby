#### Thank's for visiting

I'm a polyglot programmer focused on dynamic languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP). I specialize in building client-server systems based on the HTTP protocol (websites, web applications, inter-application APIs). 

I have experience as a:

 * programmer,
 * software architect,
 * project manager,
 * UX designer,
 * scientific researcher,
 * and technical writer.

I have been actively following the evolution of web technologies since I started designing websites in 1996. I have been programming professionally for over 10 years now and my skills include coding in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, PHP and Perl) and frameworks (Django, Zend, CodeIgniter, ExtJS, AngularJS). I had the opportunity to work in the area of Bioinformatics on projects utilizing artificial intelligence and sequence analysis techniques. I currently work as a software project manager and lead developer.
